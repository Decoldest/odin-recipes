    <h3>Traditional Potato Latkes</h3>
    <p>Latkes are basically a potato pancake in traditional Ashkenazi jewish cuisine. The main Ingredients
      are obviously potato, with onion, egg, flour and an oil. Some other recipes also include
      vegetables to add a different flavour profile, namely carrot or zucchini. If you're feeling
      like a little extra zip, serve with applesauce or smoked salmon.
    </p>Potato latkes are made for celebrating Hannukah but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy
      these delicious potato flapjacks all year round. Be careful not to eat too many of these, however.
      They have a lot of calories and fats due to the large amounts of oil.
