<h3>Carbonara Pasta Dish</h3>
<p>Carbonara is a delcious pasta dish usually made with a long, skinny pasta shape like spaghetti. 
  The sauce is made of an emulsion of egg, cheese, pepper, pork fat, and pasta water. Rigatoni and bucatini
  are also common options for pasta.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, the cheese used for the robust flavours of this dish are pecorino romano, with
  some recipes calling for the addition of parmesano regiano. Guanciale, or pork jowl, is used 
  for its rich taste and extremely high fat content, which simultaneously allows for emulsification.
