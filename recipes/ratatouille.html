    <h3>Vegetables With A Hint of Rat</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Ratatouille is a stewed vegetable dish served on its own or over rice. This dish mainly uses readily available
        vegetables like tomato, carrot, garlic, onion, zucchini, eggplant, and bell pepper. Plating can come in different
        ways, but usually the vegetables are stacked in a circular dish.
      </p>
      <p>Remy the rat served this dish to Anton Ego for the review of Gusteaus's. While aused at first, Ego
        fell in love with the dish and memories of his childhood began to flow back to him. Gusteau's was 
        later closed due to health inspection reasons, but Remy continued to serve the dish at his 
        new restaurant La Ratatouille.
